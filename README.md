Hi, I'm Badr a full-stack web engineer . I have a passion for technology ,computers and science since i was young.Coding for me is a portal to endless posibilities where you can express your idea and dreams. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I am also an open-source enthusiast . I learned a lot from the open-source community and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.



```typescript
const Badr = {
    code: ["Javascript", "Typescript", "Python", "Java", "php","C#"],
    Interest: ["Robotic", "tech", "spacial", "Mobile"],
    technologies: {
        backEnd: {
            js: ["node", "Express", "Nest"],
            Java: ["Spring Boot"],
        },
        frontEnd: {
            js: ["React", "Next","Gatsby"],
            css: ["Material-ui", "tailwind", "bootstrap"]
        },
        mobileApp: {
            native: ["React Native", "Ios Development"]
        },
        devOps: ["Jenkins", "Docker", "kubernetes", "Nginx"],
        databases: ["Postgres","MySql","sqlite","SQLite","MongoDB","Redis"],
        misc: ["Firebase", "Socket.IO","open-cv"]
    },
    architecture: ["Serverless Architecture", "Progressive web applications", "Single page applications"],
    currentFocus: "Android Developpement",
    
} as const;
```
